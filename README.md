# Discord Honeypot System - CONCEPT

The Discord Honeypot System is a sophisticated monitoring tool designed to enhance server security and moderation efficiency. Utilizing multiple Discord accounts, each running in dedicated Virtual Machines (VMs) or Docker containers, this Python-based system automates the surveillance of direct message (DM) activity. Its primary objective is to detect, capture, and relay suspicious or unwanted DM communications to a specific channel within a designated server for further action by the moderation team.

## Key Features

- **DM Monitoring:** Automatically captures screenshots of DMs, sender profiles, and other critical information.
- **Information Gathering:** Collects sender's profile picture URL, username, nickname, UserID, mutual servers, exact message time (epoch time), and full message contents.
- **Dynamic Profile Customization:** Honeypot accounts can change their profile picture, username, nickname, about me section, pronouns, profile background color, status, and rich presence at user-defined intervals to maintain a low profile and attract different target groups.
- **Scalability:** Designed to efficiently scale from a few accounts to more than 10, ensuring adaptability to various operation sizes.

## Capabilities

The system's honeypot bots are equipped with the following customization abilities to enhance their effectiveness and remain undetectable:

1. **Profile Picture:** Randomly changes from a list of 1,000 curated images.
2. **Username & Nickname:** Randomly changes from a list of 10,000 curated names.
3. **About Me & Pronouns Sections:** Randomly changes from a list of 10,000 curated texts.
4. **Profile Background Color:** Randomly selects from a wide range of color values.
5. **Status Updates:** Switches between online, away, do not disturb, and offline statuses.
6. **Rich Presence:** Simulates activity such as playing a game from a list of 100 curated titles.
